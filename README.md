## Testing locally

0. Clone the repo.
   ```bash
   $ gh repo clone dhruvkb/issue-projector
   ```
0. Install dependencies.
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```
0. Export environment variables into the current shell by creating an `.env`
   file. This variables defined in the file are a little different because we
   prepend `INPUT_` to each of the inputs that the script takes.
   ```bash
   INPUT_ACCESS_TOKEN='REDACTED'
   INPUT_ORG_NAME='purelyfortesting'
   INPUT_PROJECT_NUMBER='1'
   INPUT_COLUMN_NAME='Pending_Review'
   INPUT_EXCLUDED_PROJECT_NUMBER='2'
   INPUT_ISSUE_TYPE='any'
   INPUT_INTERVAL='4'
   INPUT_INTERVAL_UNIT='h'
   ```
0. Run the TypeScript build server that watches the files and recompiles them
   upon changes.
   ```bash
   $ npm run watch
   ```
0. Execute the compiled script.
   ```bash
   $ npm run exec
   ```
